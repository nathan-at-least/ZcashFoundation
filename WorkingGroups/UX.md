Zcash Usability
===============

- _Statement of purpose:_
  The Zcash development team has prioritized developing `zcashd` as an infrastructural component rather than a consumer facing product. This working group focuses on coordinating between user-facing applications such as wallets and exchanges and the Zcash development effort. This coordination has two priorities:

  1. Defining standards which improve the *secure usability* and *interoperability* across Zcash applications.
  2. Ensuring the `zcashd` RPC interface and other low-level tools meet the needs of application developers, and that the developers understand existing application use cases.
